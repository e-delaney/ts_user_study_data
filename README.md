# ts_user_study_data
Data from a user study comparing factual and counterfactual explanation explanations for a time series classification task (Engine Fault Detection). Participants were recruited on Prolific. To gain an insight into the task and materials in this study, we strongly encourage the reader to trial the user study for both groups ([Factual](https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/7404009/ED-Factual-XP) and [Counterfactual](https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/7404353/ED-CF-XP)). This repository contains the data and images used in the tasks. It also contains the data collected from the user study (in CSV format) that was used to get results. A sample notebook showing how to load and process this data is available within the counterfactual_XPs file.
